            <h2>Pat Yongpradit</h2>
            <h4>Code.org</h4>
            <p>Pat Yongpradit is the Director of Education for Code.org, the non-profit dedicated to promoting computer science education. His passion is to bring computer science opportunities to every school and student in the United States. He is currently a national voice on K-12 computer science education and is featured in the book, “American Teacher: Heroes in the Classroom.” Throughout his career as a high school computer science teacher, he inspired students to create mobile games and apps for social causes, and implemented initiatives to broaden participation in computer science among underrepresented groups. As a result, enrollment in his school’s computer science program doubled, the number of girls taking advanced computer science tripled, and many of his students went on to majors and careers in computing. Pat has also written and consulted on technology curricula at the local, state and national level and in 2010 was recognized as a Microsoft Worldwide Innovative Educator. In addition to teaching computer science, he is certified in biology, physics, math, health, and technology education. While Pat currently spends more time focusing on CS education at the national level, he still continues to find ways to get into the classroom and work with students, because at his core he will always be an educator.</p>
