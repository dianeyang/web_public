            <p>Karen Brennan is an Assistant Professor at Harvard University in the Graduate School of Education.
She completed her PhD at the MIT Media Lab in the Lifelong Kindergarten group.

Her research is primarily concerned with the ways in which learning communities support computational creators -- and how technologies and environments can be designed for these learning communities.
She is particularly interested in Scratch.

In addition to communities of practice and computational creation, she is interested in design education, computer science education, gender equity, and curriculum development.

She has a BSc in computer science and mathematics, a BEd in the same areas, and an MA in curriculum studies - all from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
