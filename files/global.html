              <h3>Hong Kong (2012)</h3>

              <p>In August 2012, DLP deployed 30 XO laptops at two primary schools in Tin Shui Wai and Tuen Mun, low-income neighborhoods on the outskirts of Hong Kong. DLP volunteers conducted technology classes with Kindergarten students and their teachers. One Laptop per Child Asia Pacific was DLP's key local partner in planning and running the program.</p>

              <p>With students, we focused on language arts and math subject areas. In teacher training sessions, we reviewed lesson plans and discussed possible ways to integrate the XO laptop into curriculum over the coming year. We are currently providing remote support and assistance with lesson plan development this fall.</p>

              <h3>Nicaragua (2010)</h3>

              <p>In January 2010, DLP worked with the Inter-American Development Bank to set up an XO laptop check-out library at the Nicaraguan Deaf Association in Managua (Asociación Nacional de Sordos de Nicaragua, known as ANSNIC). Seven DLP volunteers brought 10 XO laptops for the library and taught computer classes for deaf students at ANSNIC. Disabled students are often left out of the One Laptop per Child equation, so we are exploring how to close this gap.</p>

              <p>In an age of rapid technology expansion, there is an unparalleled opportunity to eliminate the typical constraints faced by deaf students in the classroom. Technology is particularly liberating for deaf people because it provides access to new modes of communication.</p>

              <p>Due to poor detection mechanisms and a struggling education system, many deaf children in Nicaragua are lagging behind their hearing peers in school. Fostering a deaf community outside of the home is critical since most parents of deaf youth do not learn sign language. The Nicaraguan Deaf Association is as much a community center as it is an NGO headquarters. Most students from local Managua schools spend their mornings at the Association, working with tutors on homework before heading to class. We worked with these students to enhance their computer skills, so that they could integrate technology into their daily lives.</p>
