              <h3>Summary</h3>
              <p>The Digital Literacy Project is a non-profit organization at Harvard College that was founded in 2008 to promote digital literacy around the globe. We provide computers and computer classes for low-income schools, allowing disadvantaged students to develop valuable technology skills. We work locally in the Greater Boston area to teach computer science to students who have low accessibility to computers. We combine the supply of computers with on-site computer training both domestically and internationally, recently in Nicaragua and Hong Kong. Our twofold mission is to supply and educate, thereby enhancing digital literacy for students around the world.</p>
              
              <h3>Our Motivation</h3>

              <p>The need to increase American students' interest in Computer Science and other STEM areas is clear. By 2018, the United States is projected to have 1.2 million job openings in STEM-related fields and 80% of jobs created in the next decade are projected to require technology skills. Meanwhile, only 16% of B.A.s granted in 2020 will be in STEM fields. Technology industry leaders point to low levels of student interest in computer scienceas a serious concern. Increasing student interest in STEM will broaden their horizons and open innumerable doors of opportunity.</p>

              <p>Middle school computer science courses will expose students to a dynamic and engaging STEM field, helping them to understand how a long-term dedication to STEM courses can result in intellectual stimulation and exciting career opportunities. The opportunity is particularly important to female students, who are vastly underrepresented in STEM fields and who are also disproportionately likely to list a STEM class as a top factor in sparking their interest in the field.</p> 

              <p>In addition to helping students explore and develop interests in STEM careers, DLP will engage students in the intellectual and personal fulfillment that comes with mastering an entirely new skill set.</p>
